## The Composition of Power: Insights into MEP Demographics and Roles
Project Overview

# Key Findings
The analysis revealed several significant insights:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the European Parliament's composition and dynamics for the 2019-2024 term. The analysis focuses on key aspects such as gender representation, political distribution by country and party, roles of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), and their committee memberships. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the European Parliament's structure and the diversity within its ranks.

# Gender Representation: The European Parliament exhibits a relatively balanced gender representation, reflecting efforts towards gender equality.
Political Distribution: The Parliament consists of a diverse political landscape, with representation from various countries and political groups, illustrating the complexity and multifaceted nature of European politics.
Roles and Responsibilities: There is a clear delineation of roles within the Parliament, with specific distributions in leadership positions and committee memberships.
Committee Memberships: The data highlights the most popular committees and the extent of cross-party participation, showcasing areas of legislative focus and expertise among MEPs.

# Data Collection
Data for this project was sourced from publicly available records and official databases on the European Parliament's website. The dataset includes detailed information about MEPs, such as their names, countries, political groups, roles, and committee memberships. The data collection process involved:

Extracting relevant datasets from European Parliament's Official Website.
Ensuring data accuracy and completeness before proceeding with analysis.

# Data Analysis
The data analysis was performed using Python, employing libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning applications. Key analysis steps included:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and standardizing data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into data distribution and relationships between different variables.
Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to visually represent findings.
Advanced Analysis: Implementing clustering and correlation analysis to uncover deeper insights.

# Skills and Growth
During this project, I developed and refined several key skills:

Data Wrangling: Improved my ability to clean and preprocess large datasets.
Data Visualization: Enhanced my skills in creating meaningful and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
Machine Learning: Gained experience with clustering algorithms and understanding their application in political data analysis.
Web Development: Applied HTML and CSS skills to present the findings online effectively.

# Challenges and Future Work
While the project achieved its main objectives, there were areas that presented challenges or opportunities for further exploration:

Advanced Predictive Analysis: Due to time constraints, more sophisticated predictive modeling, such as forecasting future MEP distributions or role changes, was not fully explored.
Interactive Visualizations: Developing interactive elements for the data visualizations could provide a more engaging user experience.
Longitudinal Analysis: A comparative study of multiple European Parliament terms would offer deeper insights into trends and changes over time.
If more time and resources were available, these areas would be the focus of further development and research.
